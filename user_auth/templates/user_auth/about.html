                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    Twenty One Pilots was formed by Tyler Joseph and three friends while they were still in high school in Columbus, Ohio, around 2009. The original lineup included Tyler Joseph, Nick Thomas, Chris Salih, and Thomas's brother, Salih Dun. The band's name was inspired by the play "All My Sons" by Arthur Miller, where a character must decide whether to send faulty airplane parts to pilots during World War II.After releasing two self-produced albums, "Twenty One Pilots" (2009) and "Regional at Best" (2011), the group faced changes in its lineup. Nick Thomas and Chris Salih departed, leaving Tyler Joseph as the lead vocalist and main songwriter. Shortly after, Josh Dun joined as the drummer in 2011, finalizing the current duo. Their musical journey gained momentum with the signing to Fueled by Ramen in 2012, leading to the release of their breakthrough album, "Vessel" (2013), and marking the beginning of their rise to international acclaim.
